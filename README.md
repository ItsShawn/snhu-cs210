### Project Summary
This project provides a simple clock system that can display time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats. The program allows the user to input an initial time and subsequently add hours, minutes, or seconds to it. The updated time is then displayed in both the 12-hour and 24-hour format. This serves as a useful tool for visualizing time in two different formats and understanding the nuances between them.

### Achievements
- **Modularity**: The project is structured in a modular fashion with clear separation between the generic clock functionality (`Clock` class) and specific implementations (`Clock12Hour` and `Clock24Hour` classes).
- **Inheritance**: Efficient use of object-oriented principles, particularly inheritance. This ensures that common functionalities are in the base class, while specific functionalities are overridden in derived classes.
- **User Interaction**: Simple and intuitive user interface with a menu system to interact with the program.

### Potential Enhancements
- **Error Handling**: Incorporate error handling for incorrect user inputs, such as invalid time entries.
- **Extend Functionality**: The ability to subtract hours, minutes, or seconds could be added.
- **Optimization**: The current method of adding hours, minutes, or seconds involves condition checks every time. This can be further optimized.
- **Security**: Although not a primary concern for this kind of application, it's always good to consider secure coding practices to ensure data integrity.

### Challenges and Solutions
- The most challenging part was designing the system in such a way that the functionalities are appropriately divided between the base and derived classes. This was overcome by a thorough understanding of the requirements and proper planning before coding.
- Resources such as online forums, official documentation, and peers were invaluable in providing solutions to some of the coding challenges.

### Transferable Skills
- Object-oriented programming principles: These principles, including inheritance and polymorphism, are fundamental and are used in various software development projects.
- User interface design: The ability to create a simple and intuitive user interface is crucial in many applications to enhance user experience.
  
### Code Maintainability
- **Comments**: The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose and functionality of each function.
- **Clear Naming Conventions**: Variables and functions are named descriptively which makes the code self-explanatory.
- **Modularity**: The code is divided into logical units (functions and classes) which makes it easy to understand, modify, and extend.
- **Consistent Coding Style**: The code follows a consistent style, making it easier to read and understand.
